# Word-Translation
Lab for Python Dictionaries and Lists

You will be writing a program that translates a single word to a new one using a given alphabet.

The original English alphabet is composed of the letter 'a' as the first character, 'b' as the second, 'c' as the third...'z' as the 26th character. This alphabet can be put into a **string** like "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", so 'a' is the zeroth index and 'z' is the 25th index.

If we change that string to "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", we are essentially translating 'a' to 'A', 'b' to 'B', 'c', to 'C'...'z', to 'Z' (also known as making words uppercase). Using this new alphabet, the word "cat" will become "CAT", since 'c' is replaced by 'C', 'a' is replaced by 'A', and 't' is replaced by 'T'. The new alphabet can be any valid character in Python.
